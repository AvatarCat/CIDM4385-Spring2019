# ReactJS Code
## CIDM 4385 - Spring 2019

Projects in this REPO:
* __Pizza Example__
* __React Basics Review__
* __React Guide__ Working through the materials from the ReactJS tutorial (covers 16.x)
* __React Standard__ Using `create-react-app` to develop the Pizza Bandit Example
* __React Tutorial__ Code from the [ReactJS website](https://reactjs.org/) that follows the tutorial there.

Things we need:
* Bootstrap: `npm install --save bootstrap`
* jQuery: `npm install --save jquery`
* Popper.js: `npm install --save popper.js`
* mapbox gl: `npm install --save mapbox-gl`
* react mapbox gl: `npm install --save react-mapbox-gl`
* dotenv: `npm install --save dotenv`

Why we need them:

* __Bootstrap__ will be used for creating styles and look-and-feel for our pages
* __jQuery__ is needed by Bootstrap
* __Popper.js__ is also needed by Bootstrap
* __Mapbox GL__ and __React Mapbox GL__ a free-(ish) map solution
* __Dotenv__ is for storing API KEYS that our app uses rather than hard-coding them into our repository.  (see note below)

DOTENV note: The ENV features are built into create-react-app now.  See [Adding Custom Environment Variables](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables) for more.
